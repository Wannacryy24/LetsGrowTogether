            content: 'In React, controlled components are those whose form data is handled by the componentâ€™s state. The form elements derive their value from the componentâ€™s state, and any changes are handled through event handlers that update the state. This approach allows for better control over the form data and enables features like validation and conditional rendering. In contrast, uncontrolled components store their form data in the DOM, and React does not manage the state. Accessing the data typically requires using refs. Understanding the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components is important for managing form inputs effectively and ensuring a seamless user experience in React applications.'

            title: 'What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?',
            content: 'Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are advanced patterns in React that allow developers to reuse component logic. An HOC is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component, enhancing the original one with additional capabilities. This pattern is often used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, data fetching, or adding behavior to components without modifying their original code. HOCs help in maintaining the separation of concerns and improving code reusability. Understanding HOCs is essential for building scalable applications and effectively managing component logic in larger React projects, as they provide a way to compose and enhance components in a modular manner.'
